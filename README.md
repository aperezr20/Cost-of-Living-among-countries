## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Use the Python version 3.7.8 and install the libraries in the requirements.txt file of this repo

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the Global Cost of Living data from Numbeo to answer the following:

1. What are the countries with highest and lowest Salary-Cost ratio considering the following indicators?
   - Cost of a meal in an inexpensive restaurant
   - Cost of gasoline
   - Cost of basic services
   - Cost of a Square Meter to buy an apartment in City Center
   
2. Do countries with highest Cost of Living Index are necessarly the ones with highest purchasing power index? 

3. It is possible to accurately predict the average monthly salary of a country based on their living costs?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available in the data folder to show visualizations, tables, and inferences to answer the above questions step by step. The notebook initially describes the data and has markdown cells to guide you throughout the project's questions, process, and conclusions. 

There are two .csv files that contain data about the cost of living in different cities.

Finally, there are three other files (.dbf, .shp, and .shx) that will be used for visualization purposes in some cells of the notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@aleperez119/top-5-countries-you-should-move-to-if-you-want-to-increase-your-purchasing-power-b524a6dc1787).
